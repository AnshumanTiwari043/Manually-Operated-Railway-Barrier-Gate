# ‚öôÔ∏è Manually Operated Railway Barrier Gate

üìå Project Overview
The Manually Operated Railway Barrier Gate is a functional mechanical system designed and constructed as part of an academic group project. The goal was to develop a manually controlled crossing barrier to enhance safety at the college staff colony railway entrance.

The project involved the full design-to-installation process, including mechanical fabrication, raw material procurement, workshop execution, and administrative coordination. It serves as a practical demonstration of mechanical project execution in real-world conditions.

‚úÖ Project Status: Completed (January 2025)
The barrier gate is successfully installed and operational. It is used regularly to control passage across the campus railway track.
